## Stroop Test project

This is the project from the Inferential Statistics portion of the nanodedgree. We were asked to use descriptive statistics and a statistical test to analyze the Stroop effect, a classic result of experimental psychology. Then we were to give our readers a good intuition for the data and use statistical inference to draw a conclusion based on the results.
